Ceramics, among the earliest industrial pursuits of humanity, possesses inherent artistic qualities, evolving into an esteemed art form from its nascent stages. The diverse tribes and civilizations that once inhabited the region now known as Bulgaria have bequeathed a rich cultural legacy, with Thracians, Romans, Slavs, and Proto-Bulgarians leaving behind varied ceramic traditions. The proximity to the Mediterranean, with its vibrant culture, further shaped the evolution of Bulgarian crafts.

At DankoHandmade, we pay homage to these traditions by infusing them with a contemporary touch. Each product line we offer boasts its unique style and character, yet all emanate the comfort and warmth reminiscent of the Bulgarian landscape.

GREENWARE:
When a piece of pottery reaches the greenware stage, it has undergone complete drying, losing all moisture through evaporation and gaining rigidity. At this point, it is delicate and brittle—any attempt to bend, add, or carve will result in breakage. This passive state marks the clay's readiness for its inaugural firing.
