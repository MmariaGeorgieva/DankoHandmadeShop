Ceramics, among the earliest industrial pursuits of humankind, possesses inherent artistic qualities that render it an art form from its nascent stages. The cultural tapestry of Bulgaria's historic lands, once inhabited by diverse tribes and peoples such as Thracians, Romans, Slavs, and Proto-Bulgarians, has bequeathed a rich legacy of varied ceramics. Influenced by the Mediterranean's cultural richness, Bulgarian crafts have evolved through the ages.

At DankoHandmade, we cherish and contemporize these traditions, infusing each product line with its unique style and character, yet all resonating with the comforting warmth of the Bulgarian terrain.

BISQUE FIRING
Following the drying of a clay piece to greenware, it undergoes the initial firing in the kiln, reaching around 1800 degrees F (980 degrees C). This crucial step strengthens the ware, enhancing its durability for subsequent glazing. The porosity retained at this stage facilitates the absorption of glaze during the next phase. The bisque firing, marked by a gradual temperature ascent, demands precision to prevent potential explosions. After reaching the target temperature, the kiln is slowly cooled, unveiling the bisque ware, primed for the intricate glazing process.
