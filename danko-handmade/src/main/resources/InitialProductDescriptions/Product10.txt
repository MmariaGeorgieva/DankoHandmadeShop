Revitalizing Ceramics Through Tradition:
Ceramics, an ancient craft marking one of humanity's earliest industrial pursuits, holds innate artistic qualities that transcend mere functionality. From its nascent stages, ceramics have been recognized as an art form, resonating with cultural echoes across generations.
The diverse tapestry of tribes and peoples that once inhabited the lands now known as Bulgaria has bequeathed a rich cultural heritage. Over time, the region has become a repository of various ceramic styles, showcasing the artistic expressions of Thracians, Romans, Slavs, and Proto-Bulgarians. The geographical proximity to the Mediterranean, with its vibrant cultural tapestry, further shaped the evolution of Bulgarian crafts.
At DankoHandmade, we honor this legacy by infusing tradition with a contemporary twist. Each product line we offer possesses a distinct style and character, yet all exude the timeless comfort and warmth rooted in the Bulgarian soil.

WEDGING:
Embark on the first step of our meticulous process - wedging. This hands-on technique involves skillfully rotating and pressing a clay ball on a table. Beyond the apparent simplicity lies a crucial objective: to seamlessly homogenize the clay while eliminating any lurking air bubbles. The presence of these air pockets could lead to catastrophic consequences in the kiln, resulting in pot explosions. A ruined pot, and potentially others nearby, would bear witness to the havoc caused. Detecting air in the clay is akin to finding holes, reminiscent of Swiss cheese, when slicing through it with a wire. Our commitment to perfection begins at this fundamental stage, ensuring the foundation for exquisite craftsmanship.
