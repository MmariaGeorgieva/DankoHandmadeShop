Slip-casted Porcelain Bowl with Handpainted Fish in Blue, Black, Orange, and White.
This unique item may have multiple uses - it could be a jewel box, an olives plate, a small fruit bowl, a nuts bowl, a candle holder, a tapas plate, or a coins tray. It could be used as a cat bowl as well.
The bowl is slip-casted, then shaped by hand, dried, bisque-fired, painted, glazed, and fired for a second time. It is entirely handmade - from the preparation of the clay to the removal from the kiln. The drawing is handpainted with underglaze paints, then the bowl is covered with transparent glaze. It is one of a kind as the drawing will not be repeated on another tray.

Approximate measuring: 4.6 inches / 12 cm wide and long; 2.7 inches / 7 cm high.
