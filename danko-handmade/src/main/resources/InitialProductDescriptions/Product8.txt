Ceramics, among the earliest industrial pursuits of humanity, possesses inherent artistic qualities that elevate it to the status of art, even in its nascent stages. The diverse tribes and peoples that once inhabited Bulgaria's lands have left an indelible cultural legacy, with Thracians, Romans, Slavs, and Proto-Bulgarians contributing to the rich tapestry of ceramics across the ages. The region's proximity to the Mediterranean, with its cultural wealth, has profoundly shaped the evolution of Bulgarian crafts.

GLAZING:
Following the bisque firing, the intricate process of glazing unfolds. This transformative step involves applying a blend of ground glass, clays, coloring materials, and water onto the bisque pot through techniques like dipping, pouring, spraying, brushing, or a combination thereof. Carefully, the footring is left free of glaze, and the pot finds its place on a bisque-fired 'cookie' crafted from stoneware clay. With these meticulous steps completed, the pot awaits the final glaze firing, ready to emerge as a unique piece of artistry.
