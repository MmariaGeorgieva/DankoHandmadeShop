    <h1>About the Author</h1>
    <p>Danko is familiar with the process of pottery making since childhood. He is a graduate of the Applied Arts School in Troyan, Bulgaria, and a graduate of the National Academy of Arts in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p>
    <p>Hi, I am Danko and I love my job. I was born in Pleven, Bulgaria, and pottery has become a beautiful and
        romantic part of my life. As a boy, I used to spend time with its magic - my grandmother worked in a ceramics workshop and I watched the shapeless clay turn into plates, cups and other items. I followed it come alive in the hands of the skilled craftsmen, I saw how the glazes changed inside the kiln, how the hot shapes glowed through the small opening in its door. I admired the way the pots cooled down and gradually showed their true colors. I said to myself, "I want to do it!" It was love at first sight, and it stayed for life.</p>

    <h1>About the Working Process</h1>
    <p>The Balkan Peninsula has been a place of civilizational collision of several cultures. Thracians, Greeks, Slavs, Turks and Proto-Bulgarians have influenced what we call Bulgarian culture. People in these lands still preserve traditions and customs of ancient times. They sing songs, dance and weave motifs without even knowing where it all comes from. Even subconsciously we carry the old traditions of times past. This cultural input can be seen in the products of DankoHandmade. The bright colors of the Bulgarian national costumes, the traditional shapes and ornaments, the functionality of the items. For over 25 years, our workshop has been trying to continue this tradition by interpreting it in a modern way.</p>

    <p>Most of the items you see in our shop are wheel thrown on a pottery wheel, then dried, bisque fired, glazed and fired for a second time. They are entirely handmade - from the preparation of clay to the removal from the kiln. Here are the stages in the pottery making process:</p>

    <p><strong>CLAY PREPARATION</strong><br>
        The first step in working with ceramics is finding of a plastic clay body. In the past, potters had to dig their own clay from locally available sources as there were no other options. Some potters still dig their own clay and feel a valuable connection to the earth through this process. This process is quite labor intensive and is very difficult for urban potters today. Most buy commercially available clay bodies from ceramic suppliers in the area they live in, as shipping costs for something as heavy as clay can become very expensive.</p>

    <p><strong>WEDGING</strong><br>
        Wedging is the process of mixing the clay by hand by rotating and pressing a clay ball on a table. The purpose is to thoroughly homogenize the clay and to remove the air bubbles. This is particularly important, as the presence of air bubbles in the clay will result in explosions during firing, as the air pockets expand and burst. Thus the pot will be ruined, as well as any other pots that are near it in the kiln. One knows if there is air in their clay if they see holes, like in Swiss cheese, when they slice through the clay with a wire.</p>

    <p><strong>THROWING</strong><br>
        Throwing clay is the process of using a rapidly rotating pottery wheel and other tools to form a lump of clay into a beautiful ceramic piece. The procedure involves placing a lump of clay in the exact center of the wheel head, creating an opening in the exact center of the clay. The size of the opening is gradually increased and the sides are pulled up until a cylinder is formed. A sufficient amount of clay is left for the bottom of the piece. The sides and mouth of the piece are then shaped, and the piece is removed from the wheel. Once it dries to a leatherhard stage, the potter can then go about trimming away excess clay, adding handles, spouts or attachments, and carving, cutting, or re-shaping the piece. An experienced potter can make this process look easy, but it takes many years of dedication and long hours of practice to become efficient at throwing and creating balanced, beautiful pieces.</p>

    <p><strong>DRYING</strong><br>
        When the clay bag is opened, the drying process begins. As clay dries, it loses water, becomes stiffer, and shrinkage begins. After throwing (or forming in another way), pieces should be wrapped in soft sheets of plastic (without holes). The plastic will slow down (but not stop) the drying process, to ensure that several days later, the pieces will still be workable. If they dry too fast, that will cause cracking, and the potter won't be able to continue working with the piece.</p>

    <p><strong>GREENWARE</strong><br>
        When a piece of pottery has dried completely, it is referred to as a piece of greenware. This means it has lost all water through evaporation and has no flexibility. Bending it will break it. You cannot add anything to it. You cannot carve anything from it. You cannot do anything to it except break it. This is purely a passive state for the clay awaiting the first firing (the bisque firing).</p>

    <p><strong>BISQUE FIRING</strong><br>
        After a clay piece has dried to greenware it is loaded into the kiln for the first of two firings, that is to approximately 980 degrees C. This hardens the ware making it easier to handle without breaking during the glazing process. Clay fired at this temperature still retains its porosity. The porosity of a material refers to its ability to absorb liquids. The water in the glaze is absorbed by the porous bisque ware, and the glassy materials in the glaze are left deposited on the surface. So, the bisque process is simply done to make glazing easier. The bisque firing starts when the kiln is loaded with the dry greenware and is programmed to slowly warm. Firing too fast during this early stage can easily cause the work to explode. Next, the kiln is gradually turned higher and the temperature rises until the target temperature is reached. The kiln is then turned off and allowed to slowly cool. In the end, the kiln is opened, and the bisque ware is removed, ready for glazing.</p>

    <p><strong>GLAZING</strong><br>
        After the bisque firing the glazing process can begin. The glaze, a mixture of ground glass, clays, coloring materials and water, is applied to the bisque pot by dipping, pouring, spraying, brushing, sponging, or some combination of these techniques. The footring/legs of each piece must be free of glaze and the pot must be placed on a bisque fired 'cookie' â€“ a sheet made from a stoneware clay body. The pot is now ready for the glaze firing.</p>

    <p><strong>GLAZE FIRING</strong><br>
        The glaze firing is the second firing of the clay. Once glazes have been applied to the bisqueware and have had a chance to dry, the ware is carefully loaded into the kiln for the glaze firing. The firing temperature, depending on the materials, is between 1100 degrees C and 1280 degrees C. Pots cannot be allowed to touch at all, or the glazes will melt, welding the pots together.
        The kiln is heated slowly to the proper temperature to bring the clay and glazes to maturity, and then it is slowly cooled again. Only after the kiln has cooled will it be opened and unloaded. This is the final step in the process for the vast majority of pieces produced.
